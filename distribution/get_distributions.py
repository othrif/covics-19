'''
This file takes as an input a dataframe with the nominal costs of transportation
between different countries, plus a dictionary of the countries that have either
an excess or decifiency in medical supplies. It runs a naive approach at
optimising the districution of resources, and will return a dictionary showing
which countries should make transfers to which.
